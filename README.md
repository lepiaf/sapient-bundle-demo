# Demo for sapient-bundle

This is a demo for [sapient-bundle](https://github.com/lepiaf/sapient-bundle)

## Use case

`api-alpha` expose a route `/api/account` to let user check balance of their account.

A command in `api-beta` will do a request to this route and display balance in console.

`api-alpha` will receive the request, generate response, sign it and seal it. It means only requester can view content of response. 
Moreover, requester can verify that response is really generated by `api-alpha`.
## How to run it

Checkout repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lepiaf/sapient-bundle-demo.git
```

Enter in `api-alpha` and run composer install

```bash
cd api-alpha
composer install
```

Then run server

```bash
bin/console server:run
```

Return to directory of project and go to `api-beta`

```bash
cd ../api-beta
composer install
```

Run command to check balance.

```bash
bin/console app:check-balance
```

Balance should appear.
